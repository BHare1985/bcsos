zk-SNARKs is one of succinct and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs widely used to build a non-interactive proof protocol to improve privacy and security. Since the private key generated during the setup process of zk-SNARKs must be kept secure , zk-SNARKs requires a one-time trusted setup to generate a proving key and verification key, which are public parameters. Provers can generate non-interactive proofs using the proving key while verifiers can verify those proofs using the verification key \cite{ben2013succinct}. Recently, many solutions have adopted random oracle models for transparent setup where the trusted setup is no longer required, such as a, b and c. However, as the data size grows, not only the pre-processing cost increases but also the size of proving and verification keys increases.
